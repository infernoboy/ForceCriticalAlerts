Force Critical Alerts
=====================

**Requires iOS 12 or later**

Lets you mark certain app's notifications as "critical". This will bypass both silent mode and Do Not Disturb.
It will also change the default notification sound if an app does not specify a custom one.

Looking for a more knowledgeable developer to improve this tweak:

- Allow creation of multiple "filters" on a per-app basis
- Each filter allows checking if the notification title, subtitle, or message matches a given string
- Only mark the notification as critical if the filter evaluates to true
